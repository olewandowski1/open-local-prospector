## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- OpenCode discovery now receives only public search tools, while structuring and assessment run
  with every tool denied and external plugins disabled.
- Worker restarts now preserve the web process's clickable loopback URL in the combined development
  terminal.
- Candidate detail loading now stops on bounded request failures, offers an explicit retry, and
  previews the actual evidence, administration, and danger-zone layout while data is loading.
- API traffic now accepts the local app through either `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`, while
  state-changing routes reject foreign browser origins.
- Deleting a business now removes its task checkpoints, failures, and business-scoped Technical Run
  Log entries while retaining unrelated run history.
- Explicitly resuming with another runtime now updates unfinished discovery task input and removes
  configuration belonging to the previous provider.
- Supporting Observation timestamps must now exactly match the cited evidence supplied to the
  assessment runtime.
- The MVP quality gate now replays versioned synthetic discovery and assessment fixtures through
  production verification, identity, citation, scoring, and qualification rules without network
  access.
- A deterministic offline integration suite now exercises the assembled worker pipeline, durable
  payload handoffs, restart idempotency, and isolated per-business failure behavior.
- Page scrolling now responds across the full content region while content remains centered and
  width limited.
